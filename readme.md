# Assignment
Create a backend .NET API using this empty project (this repo) for this [frontend repository](https://github.com/EdenCoNz/recruit-react/)

In addition to providing the API for the frontend application, we want you to add a feature to call a 3rd party API for the validation.

Please note that you do not need to create the frontend code for this project unless specified, you simply need to provide the backend service that would be used for the imaginary frontend

## Spec
Sky's the limit with your implementation but there are 2 main tasks that will be assessed:

1. Input Validation Code Implementation
2. Code Structure and Architecture

### Input validation Code Implementation
- Credit card field is any number
- CVC is any number
- Expiry is any valid date
- Handle appropriately when submitted fields are invalid

### Code Structure and Architecture
- No need to implement actual 3rd party API calls, pseudocode and mocked responses should be sufficient
- At a minimum, define necessary entities and method signatures to show the use and flow of data
